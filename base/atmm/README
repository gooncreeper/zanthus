Architecture, Thread, and Memory Manager

ATMM shall provide limitable access to architecture supervisor features, thread
scheduling (timer interrupts provided externally), and memory page allocation.

ATMM will be the only task that runs in supervisor mode, and thus all tasks
that require supervisor access shall be performed in ATMM.
